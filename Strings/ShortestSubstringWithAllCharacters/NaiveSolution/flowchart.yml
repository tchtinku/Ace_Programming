Input String s
  |
Count distinct characters using a set
  |
Initialize min_length to infinity and result to an empty string
  |
Iterate i from 0 to n - 1 (start of substring)
  |
  |-> Initialize current_count (Counter) and count = 0
  |-> For each j from i to n-1 (end of substring)
  |   +> Increment current_count[s[j]].
  |   +> If current_count[s[j]] == 1, increment count
  |   +> If count == total_distinct:
  |       ++> Calculate substring length
  |       ++> Update min_length and result if substring is shorter.
  |       ++> Break Inner Loop
  | 
Print the result substring and its length
