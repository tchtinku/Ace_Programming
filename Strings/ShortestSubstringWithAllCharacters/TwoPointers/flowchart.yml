Start
  |
Input string s
  |
Find all distinct characters using a set
  |
Initialize start, end, count, frequency, minLength, and startIndex
  |
While end < len(s):
  | -> Add s[end] to frequency.
  | -> If frequency[s[end]] == 1, increment count.
  | -> While count == distCount:
  |           => Update minLength and startIndex if the current window is smaller
  |           => Remove s[start] from frequency.
  |           => If frequency[s[start]] == 0, decrement count
  |           => Increment start
  | -> Increment end.
Return the substring and its length
