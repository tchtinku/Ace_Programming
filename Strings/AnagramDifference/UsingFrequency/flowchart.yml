1. Start
2. Input:
   -> Take 2 strings str1 and str2 

3. Validation:
   -> Check if the lengths of str1 and str2 are equal:
      => If not, print an error and exit

4. Initialize:
   -> Create an array freq of size 26, initialized to 0

5. Process:
   -> For each character in str1, increment the corresponding index in freq.
   -> For each character in str2, decrement the corresponding index in freq.

6. Calculate:
   -> Compute freqDiff as the sum of the absolute values of all elements in freq.
   -> Calculate the result as freqDiff//2

7. Output:
   -> Print the result as the minimum manipulations required.

8. End

Example Execution

Input:

Enter the first string: except
Enter the second string: accept

Minimum manipulations required to make the strings anagrams: 2

Explanation

For strings except and accept

-> Frequencies of characters in except: [1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, ..., 0]
-> Frequencies of characters in accept: [1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, ..., 0]
-> Absolute frequency differences: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, ..., 0]
-> freqDiff = 4
-> Minimum manipulations = freqDiff // 2 = 4 // 2 = 2
