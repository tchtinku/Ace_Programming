Input
 -> List of words
 -> Pattern string

Initialize Mappings:
 -> mapPat and mapWord as empty dictionaries
  |
Loop Through Words
 -> For each word:
     => If the length is unequal to the pattern, skip the word
     => For each character in the pattern and word:
        ==> Case 1: If both characters are unmapped, map them.
        ==> Case 2: If the pattern character is mapped to a different word character, invalidate
            the word.
 -> Add valid words to valid_words
