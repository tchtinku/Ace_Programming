Input S (encrypted string) and K
  |
Initialize decrypted_string as an empty string and i=0
  |
While i < len(S):
    -> Extract the substring (lowercase alphabets)
    -> Extract the frequency (digits following the substring).
    -> Append the substring repeated freq_of_substring times to decrypted_string
    -> If length of decrypted_string exceeds K, break
  |
Return the (K-1)th  character of decrypted_string
