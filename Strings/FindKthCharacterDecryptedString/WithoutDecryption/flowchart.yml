1. Start
   -> Input the encrypted string S and the integer K

2. Initialize variables
   -> Set i = 0 (iterator index)

3. Substring Extraction
   -> Extract the alphabetic characters (substring) until a digit is found.

4. Frequency Calculation
   -> Extract numeric characters and compute the frequency using freq = freq*10 + int(S[i])

5. Resultant Length Calculation
   -> Calculate result_length = len(substring)*freq

6. Kth Character Check
   -> If K <= result_length, compute the characters at (K-1) % len(substring) and return it.

7. Update K
   -> If not, substract result_length from K and continue with the next substring

8. Repeat 
   -> Loop through the process until K is located or the string ends.

9. End
   -> Print the result
