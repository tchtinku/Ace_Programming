1. Start
2. Input: Arr arr and value target.
3. Initialize: 
     -> Loop index i=0
4. Iterate Over Array:
     -> If arr[i] == target, print index i and end.
     -> Else, increment i
5. Target Not Found:
     -> If the end of the array is reached, print -1
6. End

Time Complexity: O(N)
    -> In the worst case, every element in the array is visited once.
Space Complexity: O(1)
    -> Only a constant amount of extra space is used

------

Example:
Enter the array elements (space-separated): 
10 20 30 40 50

Enter the value to search:
30

Output:
Element 30 found at index 2

Example:
Enter the array elements (space-separated): 
10 20 30 40 50

Enter the value to search:
60

Output:
Element 60 not found in the array
