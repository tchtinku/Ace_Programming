The idea here is to do a linear approach which apparently is a brute force way to do this.

1. Visit every element one by one.
2. Check if the current value that we are looking at is the value that needs to be searched. If the element 
is found, return the index at which we found it .
3. Once all the elements are visited and we don't find the value, return -1

Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the total number of elements in the array

In the worst case, we have to Visit every element.

Space Complexity: O(1), since a constant amount of space is used.

--------------------------

1. Input:
   -> Accept an array of elements arr and the target value target
2. Initialise:
   -> Start iterating through the array from the first element.
3. Traverse the Array:
   -> For each element, check if it matches the target.
   -> If a match is found, return the current index
4. Not Found:
   -> If the loop completes without finding the target, return -1
5. Output:
   -> Print the result (index of the target or -1 if not found)
