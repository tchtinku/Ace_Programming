1. Start
2. Input: Array arr of 0s, 1s and 2s.
3. Count Frequencies: 
   -> Use a loop to count occurrences of 0s, 1s and 2s
4. Reconstruct Array:
   -> Overwrite the array sequentially with 0s, 1s and 2s based on counts
5. Output: Print the sorted array
6. End

-----------------------------------

Time Complexity: O(N)
    -> Two iterations of the array: one for counting and one for reconstructing.
Space Complexity: O(1)
    -> No extra space used beyond a few variables

------------------------

Example

Input: Enter the array elements (only 0s, 1s and 2s, space-separated): 0 1 2 1 0 2 1 2 0

Output: Sorted Array: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]

---------------------------------------------------

Example

Input: Enter the array elements (only 0s, 1s and 2s, space-separated): 2 2 1 0 1 0 0

Output: Sorted Array: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
