1. Start
2. Input: List of all intervals
3. Iterate: 
   -> Outer loop: For each interval i
   -> Inner loop: For each interval j>i
   -> Check overlap condition:
       if  (intervals[i][1] >= intervals[j][0] or intervals[j][1] >= intervals[i][0])
   -> If overlap found, return False
4. Output: If no overlap found, return True
5. End
