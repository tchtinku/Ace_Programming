1. Create another matrix of the same size, initially having all zeroes.
2. Replace the new matrix(i,j) with the old matrix(j,i) and traverse both matrices element by element.
If anywhere there is inequality return false, else continue.
3. In the end, return true as the entir matrix is traversed.

Time Complexity: O(N^2), as every element is visted once and there are N^2 elements in total, where N 
is the size of the square matrix

Space Complexity: O(N^2), as an extra matrix of size N*N is created while making the transpose of the matrix,
where N is the size of the square matrix.

------------- Check Symmetric Matrix Using transpose -------------

1. Input Validation: 
   -> Ensure the input matrix is square (i.e. number of rows equals number of columns).

2. Create Transpose:
   -> Create a new matrix of the same size and fill it with zeroes.
   -> Copy the transpose of the original matrix into the new matrix by swapping rows and columns.

3. Compare Matrices:
    -> Compare each element of the original matrix with its corresponding element in the transposed matrix.
    -> If any mismatch is found, return false.

4. Return Result:
    -> If no mismatch is found, return True.
