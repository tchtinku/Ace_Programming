The basic idea of this approach is to utilise the fact that elements in the row already stored in a sorted manner.

Suppose we want to create a sorted (in non-decreasing order) list of integers from the given matrix. Now let's
try to append the integers in the list one by one. Consider the 1st element of each row. The minimum of 
those elements will be the minimum element of the matrix itself. Why? Because the 1st element of each row 
is the min element of that row.

To find the second element, we will remove the smallest element, and we will consider the next element (2nd element)
of the row
