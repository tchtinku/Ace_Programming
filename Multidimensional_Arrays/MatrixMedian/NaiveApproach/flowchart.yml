Input:
Enter the number of rows (N): 3
Enter the number of cols (M): 3

Enter the elements of the matrix row by row:
1 3 5
2 6 9
3 6 9

Output:
The median of the matrix is: 5

Explanation of time complexity:
1. Insertion into aux List: This step takes O(N*M), as we traverse the entire matrix of size N*M

2. Sorting the aux List: Sorting a list of size N*M takes O((N*M)log(N*M))

3. Overall Complexity: O((N*M)log(N*M)).

-------------

Space Complexity:

1. The auxiliary array aux requires O(N*M) space.

2. Thus, the space complexity is O(N*M)
