Steps:

1. Determine Effective Rotations:
  -> Set K = K % M, where M is the number of columns in the matrix. This handles cases where K is larger than M.

2. Row-wise Rotation:
  -> For each row in the matrix:
     => Reverse the Entire Row:
        ==> Reverse all elements in the current row.
     => Reverse the First K Elements:
        ==> Reverse the first K elements of the row.
     => Reverse the Remaining Elements:
        ==> Reverse the remaining M-K elements in the row.

3. Collect the Rotated Rows:
  -> Append the rotated rows to a new matrix.

4. Return the Result:
  -> Return the rotated matrix.
