Flowchart: Rotate Each Row of a matrix by K steps

start
  |
Take input: matrix (N*M) and K (Number of rotations)
  |
Set K = K%M (to handle cases where K>M)
  |
For each row in matrix:
    |
    Reverse the entire row
    |
    Reverse the first K elements
    |
    Reverse the remaining M-K elements
  |
Append rotated rows to the result matrix
  |
Print the rotated matrix 
  |
End
