Start
  |
Take input: size of matrix (N) and target value (q)
  |
Initialize total=0
  |
Loop over rows i from 1 to N
  | 
    Loop over columns j from 1 to N
    |
    +-> If  i+j = q, increment total by 1
    |
Continue to next iteration
  |
After all loops, print total

End

Example 1:
 
Enter the size of the square matrix (N): 5
Enter the target sum value (q): 4

Output 

The total number of cells where i+j = 4 is 3.

Explanation
In a 5*5 matrix, the cells that satisfy i+j = 4 are
 (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)


Example 2:
 
Enter the size of the square matrix (N): 6
Enter the target sum value (q): 8

Output 

The total number of cells where i+j = 8 is 5.

Explanation
In a 6*6 matrix, the cells that satisfy i+j = 4 are
 (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2)
