The basic is to start traversing the matrix in spiral form and find the kth element in the traversal.

Steps:

1. We traverse the matrix in spiral form. (refer to the image in the problem statement)

2. Keep two variabkes startRow = 0, startCol=0, n and m are already ending indices of row and column.

3. Keep a variable count = 0, if (k==count), we return.

4. Start iterating i from startCol to m-1 for the first row and keep incrementing count for every element visited.

     for any i if (count == k), return 'matrix[startRow][i]'

5. Update startRow = startRow + 1.

6. Then iterate i from startRow to n-1 for the last column and keep incrementing count for every element visited.

   for any i if (count==k), return matrix[n-1][i]

7. Update m = m-1.

8. Then iterate i from m-1 to startCol with -1 jumps and keep incrementing count for every element visited.
We are iterating the last row from right to left.

     For any i if (count==k), return matrix[n-1][i]

9. Update n = n-1

10. Then iterate i from n-1 to 'startRow' with -1 jumps and keep incrementing count for every element visited. 
We are iterating the first column from bottom to top.
   
   For any i if (count==l), return matrix[i][startCol]

11. Update startCol = startCol + 1

12. Repeat the same step until count is not equal to the k.

In other words, keep iterating the matrix from left to right for the row marked by startRow, followed 
by top to bottom for the column marked by m, followed by right to left for the row marked by n, followed 
by bottom to top for the column marked  by startCol, and keep incrementing the value of count by 1 until we get 
count to be equal to k.

Time Complexity: O(N*M), where N=number of rows and M=number of cols. We are iterating every element
of the matrix.

Space Complexity: O(1), as we are using constant space.

------------------------------------

1. Initialize variables:
   -> Set startRow = 0, startCol = 0.
   -> Iterate until startRow < n and startCol < m.

2. Check cases for kth element:
   -> Case 1: If k is within the top row, return kth element of that row.
   -> Case 2: If k is within the right column, return the kth element of that column.
   -> Case 3: If k is within the bottom row, return the kth element of that row.
   -> Case 4: If k is within the left column, return the kth element of that column.

3. Update bounds:
   -> After traversing each side, adjust k by subtracting the number of elements traversed and update 
   bounds for rows (n, startRow) and columns (m, startCol).

4. Return result:
   -> If k is valid, return the result; otherwise, return -1.
